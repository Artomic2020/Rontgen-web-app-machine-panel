# Rontgen-web-app-machine-panel
The Artomic Rontgen dashboard developed concurrently as a LAMP and Node/Express (PWA) web-apps . My original project presented a UI for task flow in radiographic imaging. The research prototype consists of customizable task-bar and navigation elements for controlling the machine-panel tablet. 

Technology Statement

The Artomic RØNTGEN Project uses the following technology stack:

• HTML  
• PHP / SQL (LAMP)  
• JavaScript (vanilla)  
• JSON  
• Node.js / Express.js  
• CSS / Flexbox  
• Fusion 360  
• SVG  
• PNG  
• WOFF  
• Resource Description Framework (RDF)  
• Extensible Markup Language (XML)  
• Bluetooth LE  
• Arduino  
• WAI-ARIA

This technology selection is deliberate and intended to balance:

• Efficiency and energy optimization  
• Accessibility and interoperability  
• Ease of setup  
• Approachability for beginners  
• Cross-OS and browser support  
• Local and end-user performance  
• Database security  
• Code and development protection

When contributing to this project, please adhere to these technology choices.  
Do not introduce unnecessary complexity or third-party dependencies unless 
explicitly approved. Specifically avoid:

• 3rd-party libraries and remote server requests  
• React, Vue, and other Single Page Application frameworks

The Artomic RØNTGEN Project does not require SPA-level complexity; these 
technologies would negatively impact accessibility, increase code maintenance 
burden, and introduce potential security and performance issues.
